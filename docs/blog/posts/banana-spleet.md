# Banana Spleet

Recently I've been working on my spare time on a simple GUI app for the interesting tool called Spleeter by Deezer. Spleeter is a "source separation library with petrained models" whatever that means. It basically takes a song and splits it according to the different instruments and vocals it's AI detects. The end result is indeed quite impressive.

As Spleeter is originally just a CLI app, what I did was basically a GUI to use it. I've found a few similar projects on github but the ones that stood out to me sadly only worked on Windows (I use linux btw). **It was also a great opportunity to use this silly name.**

My take on this was using python, not only because I'm already quite familiar with this language, but also because that's also what Spleeter is built with, so I can easily import it's methods.

You can read more and install [from here](https://github.com/pbl0/banana_spleet).
