# @rrpablotbot

In this post I'll showcase a bit my brand new telegram bot. In the recent years I've been fairly active on a silly mobile/web game called [Rival Regions](https://rivalregions.com). I've created a dozen of bots and tools, some of them publicly available in [RR Tools](https://rr-tools.eu).

This time I bring a telegram bot which will scrape the web version of the game and retrieve useful data. It's been running for more than a month on my raspberry pi, and besides some issues with the game cookies expiring, it works great.

If you happen to also play Rival Regions and want to try [@rrpablobot](https://t.me/rrpablobot) just talk to him and send a link of the game. You can also add it to groups! [Read more](https://rr-tools.eu/pablobot).
