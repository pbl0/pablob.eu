# Hello World

This the first entry on my personal blog. I've thinking for a long time on creating a blog mostly as a reminder to my own self of the stuff I do, just because I tend to forget. Also I will take the opportunity to learn a bit of Gatsbyjs, React and English, which are all technologies that I'm not very used to.

My blog won't be centered to any specific topic: I like music, games, gardening, reading books, astronomy, linux, open source and a long list of ways of messing around with computers and alikes. And also dogs of course.

Well, that's all, hope you liked this uninspired introduction. It's been my pleasure!
