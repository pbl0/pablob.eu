# PaperTelegramBridge

Almost a year ago, I forked a Minecraft plugin that connects the chat between my Minecraft server and my Telegram group (because I'm a Discord hater).

The plugin in question was [spigot-tg-bridge](https://github.com/kraftwerk28/spigot-tg-bridge) and, despite not being updated for a couple of years, still works perfectly. Nevertheless, my goal was to add more functionalities to give my server a bit more personality.

The original plugin was in Kotlin, which is nice, and distributed under **GPL-3.0**, which I of course maintained.

The plugin has now reached a phase where I'm quite satisfied with it and has been very useful for my Minecraft server, so I finally decided to share it here.

## Features

-   Sends messages from Minecraft chat to your Telegram group and vice versa.
-   Announces joins, leaves, deaths, advancements, etc.
-   Share a screenshot of your inventory from the game by sending `[inv]`. You can also share information about the `[item]` you're holding and even share books and your `[ender]` chest.

-   `silentjoinleave` permission to disable tracking for certain players, useful if you use any vanish plugin.
-   Whitelist management from Telegram with `/whitelist`. (Admin only).

-   Configurable commands: `/online`, `/time`.

If you're interested in using it for your server, you can download it from [Modrinth](http://modrinth.com/plugin/paper-telegram-bridge). I encourage you to read the complete [Readme](https://github.com/pbl0/paper-telegram-bridge#readme) and open an issue if you find any bugs. Keep in mind that this is my first Minecraft plugin and I'm still learning.
