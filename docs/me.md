I'm Pablo, a programmer and this is my website. Professionally I've worked mostly with Angular, but from time to time I also mess around with Python, React, Godot and a few others. Besides computers and programming I also love [listening](/music) (and sometimes pretending to play) music, playing video-games and reading books. I also have fun with some gardening and taking random pictures of the sky and nature. Oh, I also like dogs, of course.

## Why did you make a website?

Why not?
